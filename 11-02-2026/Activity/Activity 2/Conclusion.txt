CONCLUSION

Stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO principle.
It is widely used in function calls, expression evaluation,
undo/redo operations, and syntax checking.
Push and Pop operations are efficient with O(1) complexity.
Understanding stack helps solve many real-world problems efficiently.
