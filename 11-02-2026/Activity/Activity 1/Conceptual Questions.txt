CONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS

--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Define Stack and explain LIFO principle.

A Stack is a linear data structure in which insertion and deletion of elements take place only at one end called TOP.

Stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, which means the element inserted last is removed first.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2. What is Stack Overflow and Stack Underflow?

Stack Overflow occurs when we try to push an element into a full stack.

Stack Underflow occurs when we try to pop an element from an empty stack.

----------------------------------------------------------------

3. Write real-life examples of Stack.

1. Stack of plates
2. Undo and Redo operations
3. Browser back button
4. Function call stack in recursion
5. Pile of books

---------------------------------------------------------------

4. What is the time complexity of Push and Pop operations?

The time complexity of Push is O(1).
The time complexity of Pop is O(1).
The time complexity of Peek is also O(1).

These operations take constant time because they are performed only at the TOP of the stack.
